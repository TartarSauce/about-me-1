    <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
      <p>I lived up and down the West Coast from California to British Columbia Cananda. I've been married for 23 years and I have 2 kids, one in college and one in high school. I've been all over the world from Ecuador to Myanmar. I play the drums, I love to cook and I've worked in the maritime industry for 24 (see work experience below).
    <h2>Work Bio</h2>
      <p>I gradulated from high school early when I was 16 years old and started to work in the maritime industry when I was 17. My first adventure on in this field was commercial diving.</p>
      <p><strong>Commercial Diving:</strong> I went to commercial diving school when I was 17 and started diving commercially shortly there after. I worked for a tanker barge company doing hull inspection and prop shaft repairs. I then moved to above water activities.</p>
      <p><strong>Marine Surveying:</strong> I started in the marine surveying business when I was 19. This job involved auditing cargo shipments and calclating manifests. This job took me to my next adventure, merchant marine.</p>
      <p><strong>Merchant Marine:</strong> I worked locally as an Able Body Seaman on Tug Boats. This involved making and breaking barge tows and assisting vessels into ports. I worked on board a manned tug boat for 6 weeks on and 4 weeks off. Then I got married. Hello shore.</p>
      <p><strong>Barge Tankerman:</strong> This was a shoreside job which intailed working still on the water but on a job to job circumstance. It involved a lot of travel where I was often flown into remote places to load and unload tank barges. Time to go into the office.</p>
      <p><strong>Marine Vessel Operations:</strong> I worked as an operations manager dispatching and crewing vessels. I made sure everyone got to their job in one piece and got home the same. In the process I work with a lot of major oil refiners. As such I took advantage of training and instruction that moved me into a lab.</p>
      <p><strong>Lab Time:</strong> I worked as a marine fuel specialist responsible for transfering petroleum in pipelines, tanker trucks, tanker barges, tanker ships and shoreside storage tanks. I then tested this material to maintain a quality product. This experience lent itself to the next stage....Marine cargo inspection.</p>
      <p><strong>Marine Cargo Inspection:</strong> I worked for a company that audited the transfers of sales of petroleum products. This involved brokering the deal and set market price based on quality. This company was the desinated "middle-man" for huge oil companies that would buy and sell from each other but didn't trust each other.</p>
